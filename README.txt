Welcome

This GitHub repo contains the website files for the nzasr.org website.
This static website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which is a free service configured within the NZASR GitHub account. 
The nzasr.org domain is hosted at Cloudflare and the web component of the DNS points to this GitHub account. 
Any updates committed to the main branch of the nzasr.org repository will immediately go live on the website. 

If you are looking for an introduction to GitHub, this is a good place to start: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world
While it may seem complex, GitHub allows multiple users to contribute to a code base (in this case the website) and has version control. This means that if a massive error is made, you can easily roll back to the previously working code. 

The Cloudflare email forwarding service will be set up so that all emails directed to contact@nzasr.org will be forwarded on to the President of the NZASR. These settings will need updated each time there is a new president elected.
